/*Develop a program in C++ to create a database of studentâ€™s information system
containing the following information: Name, Roll number, Class, Division, Date of
Birth, Blood group, Contact address, Telephone number, Driving license no. and other.
Construct the database with suitable member functions. Make use of constructor, default
constructor, copy constructor, destructor, static member functions, friend class, this
pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete as well as
exception handling.*/
